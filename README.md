# Deploying an Express Server to EC2 Instances with ALB and Route 53

## Overview

In this lab, students will learn how to deploy an Express server to an Amazon EC2 instance, create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that balances the load between multiple EC2 instances, and configure Amazon Route 53 to associate at least two Application Load Balancers (ALBs) with a custom domain name.

Upon completing this lab, students will have acquired practical knowledge in deploying and managing critical AWS services such as EC2, ALB, and Route 53. By leveraging these services, they will ensure high availability and fault protection for their applications, bolstering resilience against potential disruptions and enhancing their overall reliability.

## Prerequisites

Students should have access to their own Free Tier AWS account using appropriate IAM role and cost management to use the necessary services.

## Scope

The lab will develop the following skills:

- Deploying and managing EC2 instances
- Leveraging Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) by creating an ALB to ensure high availability
- Configuring Route 53 to associate multiple ALBs with a single domain name further bolstering high availability and fault protection.
